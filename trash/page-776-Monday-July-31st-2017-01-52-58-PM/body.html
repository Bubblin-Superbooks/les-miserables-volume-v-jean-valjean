<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>m an old French soldier, I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don&rsquo;t know what. He told me his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn&rsquo;t hear. All I caught was Merci [thanks]. I&rsquo;d rather have had his name than his thanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,&mdash;do you know what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through the grape-shot. There&rsquo;s the history of it! That general never did a single thing for me;</p></div> </div>
