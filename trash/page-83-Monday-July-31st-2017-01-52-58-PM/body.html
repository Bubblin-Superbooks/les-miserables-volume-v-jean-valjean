<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mother So-and-So, if any one should chance to come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a Spaniard, perchance, it is I.&rdquo;</p><p>This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and found distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearth and cold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: &ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;From the street.&rdquo; When he went away, they asked him: &ldquo;Whither are you going?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Into the streets.&rdquo; His mother said to him: &ldquo;What did you come here for?&rdquo;</p><p>This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants which spring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and he blamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should be.</p></div> </div>
