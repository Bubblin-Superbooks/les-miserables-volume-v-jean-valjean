<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> His house in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, &ldquo;a male and a female.&rdquo; When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province: NÃ®mois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. &ldquo;How much wages do you want a month?&rdquo; asked M. Gillenormand. &ldquo;Thirty francs.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Olympie.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have fifty francs, and you shall be called Nicolette.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
