Is not her name Musichetta?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with tiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled, with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, and produce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at Staub&rsquo;s. That will assist.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
