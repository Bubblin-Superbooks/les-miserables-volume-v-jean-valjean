When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: &lsquo;Never mind, I will come.&rsquo; When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor, on the right.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
