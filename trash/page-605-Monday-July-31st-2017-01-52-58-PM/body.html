<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won&rsquo;t put these shoes on again, and that I won&rsquo;t, for the sake of my health, in the first place, and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don&rsquo;t know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch, and go ghi, ghi, ghi, the whole time. I prefer to go barefoot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl&rsquo;s rudeness, &ldquo;but then, you will not be allowed to enter churches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go barefoot to the good God,&rdquo; he added bitterly.</p></div> </div>
