<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> a wholesale blusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unless it were an uprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it were a revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the pavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not practise it. He had taken for his device: &ldquo;Never a lawyer,&rdquo; and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned up his frock-coat,&mdash;the paletot had not yet been invented,&mdash;and took hygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: &ldquo;What a fine old man!&rdquo; and of the dean, M. Delvincourt: &ldquo;What a monument!&rdquo; In his lectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors occasions for caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like three thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.</p></div> </div>
