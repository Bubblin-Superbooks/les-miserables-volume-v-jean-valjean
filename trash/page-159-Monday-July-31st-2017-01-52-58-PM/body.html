<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>E******, the man in all France who best understood &ldquo;proportioned politeness,&rdquo; the Comte d&rsquo;Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Ch√©valier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King&rsquo;s cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night.</p></div> </div>
