<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.&rdquo;</p><p>These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius strained his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;My wife will be back shortly, don&rsquo;t get impatient. I think that the Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s done.</p></div> </div>
