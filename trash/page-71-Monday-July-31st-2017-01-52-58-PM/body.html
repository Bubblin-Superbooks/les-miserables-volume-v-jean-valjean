<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The cry: Audacity! is a Fiat lux. It is necessary, for the sake of the forward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and are one of man&rsquo;s great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises. To attempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one&rsquo;s self, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again to insult drunken victory, to hold one&rsquo;s position, to stand one&rsquo;s ground; that is the example which nations need, that is the light which electrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne&rsquo;s short pipe.</p></div> </div>
