You might have shouted &lsquo;stop thief&rsquo; a bit, and I should not have thought it improper. &lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who don&rsquo;t inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. That&rsquo;s its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make a pouf. It&rsquo;s a handy lodging.</p></div> </div>
