<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A worthy old marquise, an emigr√©e and ruined, who had but a solitary maid, continued to say: &ldquo;My people.&rdquo;</p><p>What did they do in Madame de T.&lsquo;s salon? They were ultra.</p><p>To be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not have disappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us explain it.</p><p>To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry; it is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the Pope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently royal, and that the night has too much light;</p></div> </div>
