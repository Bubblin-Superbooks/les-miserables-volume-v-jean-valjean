<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>t imagined that I should take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer&rsquo;s. Two hundred thousand francs&mdash;it&rsquo;s surely worth all that. This trifle once out of your pocket, I guarantee you that that&rsquo;s the end of the matter, and that you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: &lsquo;But I haven&rsquo;t two hundred thousand francs about me.&rsquo; Oh! I&rsquo;m not extortionate. I don&rsquo;t demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write what I am about to dictate to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
