<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>93&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to make one spit on all these young fellows, such fools are they! They are all alike. Not one escapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. The first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat&rsquo;s, thinks himself a real scoundrel, and abandons his old relatives. He&rsquo;s a Republican, he&rsquo;s a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me the favor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ran to Hernani. Now, I just ask you, Hernani! antitheses! abominations which are not even written in French! And then, they have cannons in the courtyard of the Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
