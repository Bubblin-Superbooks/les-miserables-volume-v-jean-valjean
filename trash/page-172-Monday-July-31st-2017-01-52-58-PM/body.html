<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.</p><p>These salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed in Fiévée. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M. Colnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleon was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction into history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King&rsquo;s armies, was a concession to the spirit of the age.</p><p>These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818, doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way was to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed.</p></div> </div>
