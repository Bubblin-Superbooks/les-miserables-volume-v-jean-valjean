In future, be exact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really beg you a thousand pardons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Laigle burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This erasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defend the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no more stage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am indebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you. Where do you live?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
