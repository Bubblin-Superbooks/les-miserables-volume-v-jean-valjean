Mabeuf in a low voice. &ldquo;Yes, it is true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave, spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars had already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque. There is no more beautiful legend in existence.&rdquo;</p><p>And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious reverie.</p></div> </div>
