Leblanc.</p><p>Jondrette exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor!

Leblanc&rsquo;s glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture.</p><p>There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared with black.
