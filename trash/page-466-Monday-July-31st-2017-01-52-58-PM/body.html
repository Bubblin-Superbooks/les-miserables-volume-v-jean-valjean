<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his bench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her father&rsquo;s arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again, then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming straight towards him. &ldquo;Ah! good Heavens!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I shall not have time to strike an attitude.&rdquo; Still the white-haired man and the girl advanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it was but a second. &ldquo;What are they coming in this direction for?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p></div> </div>
