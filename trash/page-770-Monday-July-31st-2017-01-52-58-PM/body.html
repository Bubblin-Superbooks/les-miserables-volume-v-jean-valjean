<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;m the one to hold the trumps to-day! You&rsquo;re in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn&rsquo;t he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn&rsquo;t even notice that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn&rsquo;t the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me.</p></div> </div>
