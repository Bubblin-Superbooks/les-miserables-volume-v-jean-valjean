In the midst of the uproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre, with this date:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;June 18th, 1815, Waterloo.&rdquo;</p><p>At this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table, beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, and began to gaze fixedly at the audience.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardieu!&rdquo; exclaimed Courfeyrac (&ldquo;Parbleu&rdquo; was falling into disuse at this period), &ldquo;that number 18 is strange and strikes me. It is Bonaparte&rsquo;s fatal number.
