The pavements were less hard to him than his mother&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>His parents had despatched him into life with a kick.</p><p>He simply took flight.</p><p>He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with a vivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch, scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gayly laughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief. He had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry because he was free.</p></div> </div>
