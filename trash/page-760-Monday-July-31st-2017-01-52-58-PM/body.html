<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Thénardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Thénardier! Now do you know me?&rdquo;</p><p>An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc&rsquo;s brow, and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No more than before.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: &ldquo;My name is Thénardier,&rdquo; Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart.</p></div> </div>
