The message could not have come from a distance. He read:&mdash;</p><p>My amiable neighbor, young man: I have learned of your goodness to me, that you paid my rent six months ago. I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill. If I am not deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor. I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity,&mdash; Jondrette. P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.</p></div> </div>
