<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of the Friends of the A B C.</p><p>What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its object apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.</p><p>They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,&mdash;the Abaiss√©,&mdash;the debased,&mdash;that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people. It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness: Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.</p></div> </div>
