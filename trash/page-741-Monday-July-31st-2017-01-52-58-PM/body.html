Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the pallets, which were empty.</p><p>&ldquo;How is the poor little wounded girl?&rdquo; he inquired.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, &ldquo;very bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,&rdquo; went on M.
