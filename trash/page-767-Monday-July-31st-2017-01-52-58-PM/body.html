Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! Ah! so you don&rsquo;t recognize me! No, it wasn&rsquo;t you who came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It wasn&rsquo;t you who carried off that Fantine&rsquo;s child from me! The Lark! It wasn&rsquo;t you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don&rsquo;t recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here.</p></div> </div>
