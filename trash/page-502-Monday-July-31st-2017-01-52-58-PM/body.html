<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A world in limbo, in the state of f≈ìtus, what an unheard-of spectre!</p><p>Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.</p><p>Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves, binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, think themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first are paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not of themselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute.</p></div> </div>
