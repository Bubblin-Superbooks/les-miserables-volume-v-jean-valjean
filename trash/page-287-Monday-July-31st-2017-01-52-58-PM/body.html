<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with irony. This was his axiom: &ldquo;There is but one certainty, my full glass.&rdquo; He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. &ldquo;They are greatly in advance to be dead,&rdquo; he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: &ldquo;There is a gibbet which has been a success.&rdquo; A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly: &ldquo;J&rsquo;aimons les filles, et j&rsquo;aimons le bon vin.&rdquo; Air: Vive Henri IV.</p><p>However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras.</p></div> </div>
