The old man bade farewell to the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.&lsquo;s salon, and established himself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid, Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and pursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.</p><p>In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year.
