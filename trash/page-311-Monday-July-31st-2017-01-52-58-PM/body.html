<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was present and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his mind.</p><p>This took place in the back room of the Caf√© Musain. Nearly all the Friends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was solemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion and with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held their peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all quarters.</p></div> </div>
