The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher&rsquo;s pole-axe for slaughtering cattle.

A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel, the thin one.</p></div> </div>
