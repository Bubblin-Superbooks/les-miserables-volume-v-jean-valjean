Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.</p><p>One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that it was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one&rsquo;s fist, wood-lice as large as one&rsquo;s foot, and perhaps even&mdash;who knows?&mdash;some monstrous human beings, must be hiding.</p><p>One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One end of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM.</p></div> </div>
