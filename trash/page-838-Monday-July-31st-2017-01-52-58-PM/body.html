<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself between the trees of the Rue de la Barrière-des-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begun operations by opening &ldquo;his pockets,&rdquo; and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den. But he had only &ldquo;caged&rdquo; Azelma. As for Éponine, she was not at her post, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. At last, he had grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nest there, sure of being in &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot.</p></div> </div>
