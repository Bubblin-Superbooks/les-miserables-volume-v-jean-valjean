<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy, jubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich folks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above us, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us &lsquo;clothes,&rsquo; as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! And bread! That&rsquo;s not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it&rsquo;s money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drink it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they, then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could have become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it!</p></div> </div>
