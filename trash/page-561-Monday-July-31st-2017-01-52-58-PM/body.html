<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius&rsquo; thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like a candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.</p><p>This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of tobacco.</p><p>There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single signer. The Spanish Captain Don Alvar√®s, the unhappy Mistress Balizard, the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.</p><p>Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are also.</p></div> </div>
