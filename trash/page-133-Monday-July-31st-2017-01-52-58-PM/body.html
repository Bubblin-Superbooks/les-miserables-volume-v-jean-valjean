<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years of age, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coat buttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same color as his trousers.</p><p>This M. de Lamothe was &ldquo;held in consideration&rdquo; in this salon on account of his &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; and, strange to say, though true, because of his name of Valois.</p><p>As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate quality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering in any way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his great age added to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment.</p></div> </div>
