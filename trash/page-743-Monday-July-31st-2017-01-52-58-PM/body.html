<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What would there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will, no work! I don&rsquo;t know how the government arranges that, but, on my word of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot. I don&rsquo;t wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word, things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: &lsquo;What! a trade?&rsquo; Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been! Alas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
