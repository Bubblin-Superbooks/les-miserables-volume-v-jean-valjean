<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my mistress. Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!&rsquo; At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: &lsquo;Marius Pontmercy!&rsquo; I replied: &lsquo;Present!&rsquo; This is why you were not crossed off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur!&mdash;&rdquo; said Marius.</p></div> </div>
