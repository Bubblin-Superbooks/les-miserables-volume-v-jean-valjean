Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,&mdash;and it was nearly every day,&mdash;he found this couple there. The man appeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: &ldquo;He is an ex-officer.&rdquo; He had a kindly but unapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one.</p></div> </div>
