Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Café Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget&rsquo;s, excellent matelotes at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the Barrière du Compat.</p></div> </div>
