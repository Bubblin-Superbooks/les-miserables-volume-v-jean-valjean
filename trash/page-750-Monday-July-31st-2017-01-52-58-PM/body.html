Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the manner of a man who is on his guard, &ldquo;it is some signboard for a tavern, and is worth about three francs.&rdquo;</p><p>Jondrette replied sweetly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to be looking on.</p></div> </div>
