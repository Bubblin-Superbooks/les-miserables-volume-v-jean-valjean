This was the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his bed.</p><p>His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly I did,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p></div> </div>
