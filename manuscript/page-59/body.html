<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, let that man go, and make haste, to say to his mother: &lsquo;Here I am, mother!&rsquo; Let him feel at ease, the task here will be performed all the same. When one supports one&rsquo;s relatives by one&rsquo;s toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one&rsquo;s self. That is deserting one&rsquo;s family. And those who have daughters! what are you thinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. And tomorrow? Young girls without bread&mdash;that is a terrible thing. Man begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride, ah!</p></div> </div>
