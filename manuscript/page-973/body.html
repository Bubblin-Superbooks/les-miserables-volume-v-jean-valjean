I was on the verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that I was born again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are full of strength and life,&rdquo; cried Marius. &ldquo;Do you imagine that a person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no more. It is I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going to live, and to live with us, and to live a long time. We take possession of you once more. There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
