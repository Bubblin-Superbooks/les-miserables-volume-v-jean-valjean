<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed night. Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of Marius and Cosette.</p><p>The day had been adorable.</p><p>It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairy spectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of the bridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door; but it had been sweet and smiling.</p><p>The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. France had not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off one&rsquo;s wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself with shame from one&rsquo;s happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song of Songs.</p></div> </div>
