<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the dead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, and of Enjolras&rsquo; sad severity. He said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell, Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was too late. Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that, even in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if there be such a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race.&rdquo;</p><p>And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment later, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire&rsquo;s verses, Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux with Cournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translated by Malfilâtre, particularly the prodigies of Cæsar&rsquo;s death; and at that word, Cæsar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.</p></div> </div>
