<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, it chanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples, particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand.</p><p>&ldquo;Shrove Tuesday!&rdquo; exclaimed the grandfather, &ldquo;so much the better. There is a proverb:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mariage un Mardi gras N&rsquo;aura point enfants ingrats.&lsquo;</p><p>Let us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, certainly not!&rdquo; replied the lover.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us marry, then,&rdquo; cried the grandfather.</p><p>Accordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding the public merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella.</p></div> </div>
