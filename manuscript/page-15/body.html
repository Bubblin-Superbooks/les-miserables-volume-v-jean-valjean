<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.</p><p>These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of night even in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those words which are intended to be insults&mdash;beggars, canaille, ochlocracy, populace&mdash;exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer; rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited.</p><p>For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain and without respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athens was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the populace saved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus Christ.</p></div> </div>
