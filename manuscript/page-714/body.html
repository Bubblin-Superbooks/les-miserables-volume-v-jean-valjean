<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don&rsquo;t belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; it&rsquo;s astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to be beautiful and contented,&mdash;that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one&rsquo;s image in one&rsquo;s little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim of life.</p></div> </div>
