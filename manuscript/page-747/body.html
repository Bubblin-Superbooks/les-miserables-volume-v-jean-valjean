Is your master up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which one? the old one or the new one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Pontmercy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; said Basque, drawing himself up.</p><p>A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something with them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the title, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militant republican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. A small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who detached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: &ldquo;My son will bear my title.&rdquo; Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness.</p></div> </div>
