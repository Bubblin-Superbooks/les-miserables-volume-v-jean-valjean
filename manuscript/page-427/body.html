It presents itself in the guise of a plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is subject to these treacheries.</p><p>This melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was also possible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.</p><p>Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain of Paris was subject to these sudden slides.</p><p>The water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which were particularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as in the ancient sewers, or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries, having no longer an underpinning, gave way. A fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack, means crumbling. The framework crumbled away for a certain length.</p></div> </div>
