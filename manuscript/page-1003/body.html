<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it for you and for your country. If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of one phrase in your letter. You write:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say: &lsquo;This book, Les Mis√©rables, is a French book. It does not concern us. Let the French read it as a history, we read it as a romance.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Alas! I repeat, whether we be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. Ever since history has been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, misery has been the garment of the human race; the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked limbs of the Man-People, the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn.</p></div> </div>
