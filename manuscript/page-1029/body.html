<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is something quite different. The question is no longer one of sacred territory,&mdash;but of a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds. But is it true that the country does wail? France bleeds, but liberty smiles; and in the presence of liberty&rsquo;s smile, France forgets her wound. And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?</p><p>Civil war&mdash;what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war between men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object. There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and unjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded, war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is hastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be necessary.</p></div> </div>
