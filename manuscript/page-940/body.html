<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Will you speak,&rdquo; retorted Marius, &ldquo;of that miserable theft, committed forty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a whole life of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I am speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne by Jean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one&rsquo;s crime, and to enjoy one&rsquo;s theft, to bury one&rsquo;s name and to create for oneself a family.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
