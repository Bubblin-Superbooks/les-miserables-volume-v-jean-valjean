<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is no young folly. The ancients did like the moderns. &ldquo;The sewers of Rome,&rdquo; says Liebig, &ldquo;have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant.&rdquo; When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted Italy, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily, then Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world. This cesspool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe. Urbi et orbi. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.</p><p>Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.</p><p>Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligent towns.</p></div> </div>
