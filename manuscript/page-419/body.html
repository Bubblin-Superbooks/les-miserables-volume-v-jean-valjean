<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley of MÃ©nilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent.</p><p>This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we are illuminating for the reader Jean Valjean&rsquo;s subterranean march, Jean Valjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day would soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become intermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he concluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that he was approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer boulevards, or the extreme outer quays.</p></div> </div>
