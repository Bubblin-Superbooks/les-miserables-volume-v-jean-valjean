<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.</p><p>He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysterious balance of light and darkness.</p><p>Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side lay the sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.</p><p>At what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?</p><p>What resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide to open? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning? Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did he nod his head?</p></div> </div>
