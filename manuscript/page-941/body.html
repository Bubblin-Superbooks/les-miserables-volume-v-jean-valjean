<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I might interrupt you at this point,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;but go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to your generosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: &lsquo;Why do not you apply to Jean Valjean?&rsquo; For a very simple reason; I know that he has stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and I consider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he would show me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money for my trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who has nothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take a chair.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
