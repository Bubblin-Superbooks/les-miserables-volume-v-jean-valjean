<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My motive?&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius. &ldquo;From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said &lsquo;I am a convict&rsquo;? Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, the unfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps me fast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able to tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to go far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried to break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore my heart with it. Then I said: &lsquo;I cannot live anywhere else than here.&rsquo; I must stay.</p></div> </div>
