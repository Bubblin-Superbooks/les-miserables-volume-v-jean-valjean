<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As for the aunt,&mdash;it had not even occurred to him that the aunt existed, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and, sheep as she was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, but impassible externally, she had said to herself: &ldquo;My father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him.&rdquo; She was rich, in fact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this point. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would have left him poor. &ldquo;So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a beggar, let him be a beggar himself!&rdquo; But Cosette&rsquo;s half-million pleased the aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned.</p></div> </div>
