Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;I was going to tell you some news. I could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is at mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent&rsquo;s room smokes, that Nicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolette have already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint&rsquo;s stammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! it is impossible? you shall see, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then who will be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here with you two.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
