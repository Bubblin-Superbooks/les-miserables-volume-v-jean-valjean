<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is a spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged capitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that metropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of impulse and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that nation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of Babylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated.</p><p>Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.</p><p>Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Paris is itself an imitator.</p></div> </div>
