<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.</p><p>As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it was impossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated, rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre. One looked at it and spoke low.</p><p>From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistle was heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped the bullet, sometimes a bisca√Øen was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or in the plaster of a wall.</p></div> </div>
