Did he know M. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s opinions? Perhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very natural presence in this combat.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of the barricade: &ldquo;My gun!&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac had it returned to him.</p><p>Gavroche warned &ldquo;his comrades&rdquo; as he called them, that the barricade was blocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was on the watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the municipal guard occupied the Rue des PrÃªcheurs. The bulk of the army was facing them in front.</p></div> </div>
