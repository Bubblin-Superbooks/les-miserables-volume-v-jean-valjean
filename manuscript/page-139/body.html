<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, and seemed to be acting as sentinel. His glance fell directly down into the barricade.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an embarrassing watcher,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>Jean Valjean had returned Enjolras&rsquo; rifle, but he had his own gun.</p><p>Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later, the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. The terrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer took his place. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his gun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer&rsquo;s casque to join the soldier&rsquo;s. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This time the warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on that roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.</p></div> </div>
