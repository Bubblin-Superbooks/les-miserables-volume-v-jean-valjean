It is your own fault, too. You save people&rsquo;s lives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext of unmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told the truth,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Marius, &ldquo;the truth is the whole truth; and that you did not tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved Javert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said so?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
