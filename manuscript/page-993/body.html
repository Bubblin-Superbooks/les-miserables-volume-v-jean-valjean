<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.</p><p>No name is to be read there.</p><p>Only, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines, which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust, and which are, to-day, probably effaced:</p><p>Il dort. Quoique le sort fût pour lui bien étrange, Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n&rsquo;eut plus son ange. La chose simplement d&rsquo;elle-même arriva, Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s&rsquo;en va.</p></div> </div>
