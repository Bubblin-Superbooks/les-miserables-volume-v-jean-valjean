Another had already overthrown Courfeyrac, who was shouting: &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; The largest of all, a sort of colossus, marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed. The urchin took in his arms Javert&rsquo;s immense gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, and fired. No discharge followed. Javert&rsquo;s gun was not loaded. The municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child.</p><p>Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from the soldier&rsquo;s grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bullet struck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, and laid him low on the pavement.</p></div> </div>
