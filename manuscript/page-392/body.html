The patrol could form a cluster in this open space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle. These bull-dogs&rsquo; heads approached each other closely and whispered together.</p><p>The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had been mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, but that they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if there was anything to do, and any &ldquo;bousingot&rdquo; to track out, it was in that quarter.</p></div> </div>
