<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: &lsquo;So he is not coming!&rsquo; Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I am well. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time ago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money.&rsquo; I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did not think to tell you to pick it up. The sun was shining bright, and it was not cold. Do you remember, Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Every one is going to die.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
