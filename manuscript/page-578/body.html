<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Gillenormand, without however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness, had not once called him father. It is true that he did not say &ldquo;monsieur&rdquo; to him; but he contrived not to say either the one or the other, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously, a crisis was approaching.</p><p>As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before giving battle, by way of proving himself. This is called &ldquo;feeling the ground.&rdquo; One morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of the Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands, and gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste and Robespierre.&mdash;&ldquo;The men of &lsquo;93 were giants,&rdquo; said Marius with severity. The old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during the remainder of that day.</p></div> </div>
