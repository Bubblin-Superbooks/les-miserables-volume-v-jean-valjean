Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javert was overwhelmed.</p><p>A galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law! And that the deed of Javert!</p><p>Was it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made to proceed with vigor, the man made to submit,&mdash;that these two men who were both the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, that both of them had set themselves above the law? What then! such enormities were to happen and no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean, stronger than the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he, Javert, was to go on eating the government&rsquo;s bread!</p></div> </div>
