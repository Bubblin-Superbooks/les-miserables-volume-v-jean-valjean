This armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible, a breach for the assault.</p><p>When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay, carried to the first floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is to drink that?&rdquo; Bossuet asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;They,&rdquo; replied Enjolras.</p></div> </div>
