The barricade is hemmed in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not on the side of the Halles,&rdquo; said Enjolras. &ldquo;The Rue Mondétour is free, and through the Rue des Prêcheurs one can reach the Marché des Innocents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; went on another voice, &ldquo;you would be captured. You would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spy a man passing in blouse and cap. &lsquo;Whence come you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you belong to the barricade?&rsquo; And they will look at your hands.
