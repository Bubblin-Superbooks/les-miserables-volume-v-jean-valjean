<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What would your aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the time, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if there was any possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctor have said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever. In short, it&rsquo;s all right, let us say no more about it, all&rsquo;s said, all&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s all settled, take her. Such is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that you did not love me. I said to myself: â€˜Here now, I have my little Cosette right under my hand, I&rsquo;m going to give her to him, he will be obliged to love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.&rsquo; Ah! so you thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice, to shout no, and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit of it. Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my well-beloved child.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
