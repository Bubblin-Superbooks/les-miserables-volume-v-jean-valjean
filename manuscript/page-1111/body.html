<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean, accompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arm√©.

There had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt advice: &ldquo;Leave your house,&rdquo; hurled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. He thought that he had been traced and followed. Cosette had been obliged to give way.</p></div> </div>
