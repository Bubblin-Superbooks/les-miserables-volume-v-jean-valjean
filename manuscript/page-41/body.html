He interdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.</p><p>They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed. Enjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up again said:&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business as a grocer.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It must be real wine,&rdquo; observed Bossuet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky that Grantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving those bottles.&rdquo;&mdash;Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs, placed his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might touch them, he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf was lying.</p></div> </div>
