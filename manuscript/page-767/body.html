<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the bottom of my soul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one must be content. Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full noonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without crying &lsquo;&lsquo;ware,&rsquo; I should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: â€˜How horrible!&rsquo; I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have a right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand!</p></div> </div>
