What then?&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac shouted:&mdash;&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Instanter,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>And with a single bound he plunged into the street.</p><p>It will be remembered that Fannicot&rsquo;s company had left behind it a trail of bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement, through the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.</p><p>The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other, short as it was.</p></div> </div>
