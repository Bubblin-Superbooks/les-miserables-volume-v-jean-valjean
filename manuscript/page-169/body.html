He rifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.</p><p>He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket in his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body to another, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut.</p><p>They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which was quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.</p></div> </div>
