The grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt Gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her, beside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.</p><p>The address as thou disappeared, the you, the &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Monsieur Jean,&rdquo; rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more and more gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely, and he felt it.</p><p>One day she said to him suddenly: &ldquo;You used to be my father, you are no longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you were Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don&rsquo;t like all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
