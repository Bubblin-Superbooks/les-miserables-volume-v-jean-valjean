He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on account of his arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand to the bride.</p><p>Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fauchelevent,&rdquo; said the grandfather to him, &ldquo;this is a fine day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there must be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right to exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace to the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at bottom.</p></div> </div>
