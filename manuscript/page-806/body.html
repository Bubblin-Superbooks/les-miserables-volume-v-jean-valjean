<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Fauchelevent who had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror.</p><p>In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain surprise.</p><p>This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored that deposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.</p><p>He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all, he had restored it all.</p><p>Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him to this. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there was acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it is a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that false name.</p></div> </div>
