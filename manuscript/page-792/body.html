<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this. That is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength for one thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir, give me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Is it not enough that you should know it? I have been able to say it myself without being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to the whole world,&mdash;it was all one to me. But she, she does not know what it is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged to explain matters to her, to say to her: &lsquo;He is a man who has been in the galleys.&rsquo; She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!&rdquo; . . . He dropped into an armchair and hid his face in his hands.</p></div> </div>
