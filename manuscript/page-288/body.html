<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless, appeared to oppress this tumult, and this young man, haughty, bloody, and charming, who alone had not a wound, who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, at that moment augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed, as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of him, possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council of war: &ldquo;There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo.&rdquo; A National Guardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered his gun, saying: &ldquo;It seems to me that I am about to shoot a flower.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
