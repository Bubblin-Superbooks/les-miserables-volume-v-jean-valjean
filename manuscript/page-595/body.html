He had under his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was of a greenish hue, and appeared to be mouldy.</p><p>&ldquo;Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?&rdquo; Mademoiselle Gillenormand, who did not like books, demanded in a low tone of Nicolette.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the same tone, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a learned man. What then? Is that his fault?
