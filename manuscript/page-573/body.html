<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The husband made a jealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried to draw Nicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, &ldquo;M. le Baron.&rdquo; He shouted: &ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo;</p><p>Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: &ldquo;Is he no longer in danger?&rdquo; He gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over him while he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himself an account of himself. Marius was the master of the house, there was abdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.</p><p>In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable of children. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent, he stepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted, charming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it is adorable. There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age.</p></div> </div>
