<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On disarranging Marius&rsquo; garments, he had found two things in his pockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening, and Marius&rsquo; pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened the pocketbook. On the first page he found the four lines written by Marius. The reader will recall them:</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M. Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating in a low tone: &ldquo;Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.&rdquo; He replaced the pocketbook in Marius&rsquo; pocket. He had eaten, his strength had returned to him; he took Marius up once more upon his back, placed the latter&rsquo;s head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed his descent of the sewer.</p></div> </div>
