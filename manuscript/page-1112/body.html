He perceived the possibility of not returning to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind nor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy. Treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity. Now Toussaint, as though she had been destined to be Jean Valjean&rsquo;s servant, was not curious. She stammered in her peasant dialect of Barneville: &ldquo;I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
