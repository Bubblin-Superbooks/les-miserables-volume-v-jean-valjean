<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen.&rdquo; On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a note which we also copy: &ldquo;In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.&rdquo; All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button.</p></div> </div>
