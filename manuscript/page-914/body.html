<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian peasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence passes by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not turn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself. Self-interest&mdash;that&rsquo;s the object of men. Gold, that&rsquo;s the loadstone.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
