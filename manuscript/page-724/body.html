One bed only was made up, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean Valjean&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, and went and came from one room to another.</p><p>Then he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a table.</p><p>He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him.</p><p>He approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was it intentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had been jealous, on the little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arm√©, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed.</p></div> </div>
