<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather heedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband still more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart, which leaned to one side only.</p><p>It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed her surprise. Then Marius calmed her: &ldquo;He is absent, I think. Did not he say that he was setting out on a journey?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; thought Cosette. &ldquo;He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for so long.&rdquo; Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arm√© whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean Valjean caused the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to be given.</p></div> </div>
