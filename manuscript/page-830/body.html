At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean Valjean&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;I will remain below,&rdquo; had been foreseen.</p><p>Two armchairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread than wool, had been spread by way of a carpet.</p><p>The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window.</p><p>Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He threw himself into one of the armchairs.</p></div> </div>
