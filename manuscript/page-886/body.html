<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He still remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:&mdash;&ldquo;The good man upstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last long. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won&rsquo;t get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:</p><p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him go without. If he has no doctor he will die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if he has one?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
