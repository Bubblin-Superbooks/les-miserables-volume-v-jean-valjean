<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave us alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are very dandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you that it will bore you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen to you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not need to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here together&mdash;that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
