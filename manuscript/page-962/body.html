I was very unhappy.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he could not speak, then he went on:</p><p>&ldquo;I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needs a bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. I gave myself reasons: &lsquo;They do not want you, keep in your own course, one has not the right to cling eternally.&rsquo; Ah! God be praised, I see her once more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? Ah! what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am fond of that pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then, thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her thou, Monsieur Pontmercy. It will not be for long.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
