Children of the Th√©nardiers, leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the ground by the wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon&rsquo;s day, and which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had been converted into rags.</p><p>Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as &ldquo;Abandoned children,&rdquo; whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again on the pavements of Paris.</p><p>It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents had caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth.</p></div> </div>
