He lighted his candle and mounted the stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there. Jean Valjean&rsquo;s step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All the cupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette&rsquo;s bedroom. There were no sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case or lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress, whose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again. All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been carried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls.</p></div> </div>
