<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in England by the word &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; It is proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The mire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were so common in former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times, &ldquo;when the people loved their kings.&rdquo; The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to have taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of that long, dark and whitish vault;</p></div> </div>
