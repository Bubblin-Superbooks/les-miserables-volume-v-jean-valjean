Phew! you don&rsquo;t smell good.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause he added:</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you questions, but you&rsquo;re perfectly right not to answer. It&rsquo;s an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate. And then, when you don&rsquo;t talk at all, you run no risk of talking too loud. That&rsquo;s no matter, as I can&rsquo;t see your face and as I don&rsquo;t know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don&rsquo;t know who you are and what you want. I twig. You&rsquo;ve broken up that gentleman a bit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river, that great hider of folly, is what you want. I&rsquo;ll get you out of your scrape. Helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
