<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I resume. This book, Les Mis√©rables, is no less your mirror than ours. Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,&mdash;I understand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; that does not prevent them from being of use.</p><p>As for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love for my own country, but without being engrossed by France more than by any other nation. In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and I become more and more patriotic for humanity.</p><p>This is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of radiance of the French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French, Italian, German, Spanish, or English, and become European, I say more, human, if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization.</p></div> </div>
