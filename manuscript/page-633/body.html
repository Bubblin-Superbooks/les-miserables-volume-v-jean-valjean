The wedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my programme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival the rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The nuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine monsters.</p><p>&ldquo;Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque Des sons si ravissants qu&rsquo;il ravissait quiconque!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
