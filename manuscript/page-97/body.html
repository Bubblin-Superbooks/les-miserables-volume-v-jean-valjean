<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones &ldquo;torn up in excess,&rdquo; said Bossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.</p><p>The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must needs come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.</p><p>An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.</p><p>Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Each man selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow and crowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones. Here is a corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here is a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind it. Left-handed men are precious; they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be at ease to kill, and to die comfortably.</p></div> </div>
