He was a corpse on which the wings could be felt.</p><p>He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute of the last hour had, evidently, arrived.</p><p>He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him.</p><p>&ldquo;Draw near, draw near, both of you.
