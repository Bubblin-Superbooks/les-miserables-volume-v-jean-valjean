The aspect of the locality has changed.</p><p>On that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who was in advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other.</p><p>It was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence. Neither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace.</p><p>One would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, and purposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty and on its guard.</p></div> </div>
