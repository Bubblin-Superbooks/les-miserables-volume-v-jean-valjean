There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which no one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those houses.</p><p>While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a few sous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed. That gibbet is always good to look at.</p></div> </div>
