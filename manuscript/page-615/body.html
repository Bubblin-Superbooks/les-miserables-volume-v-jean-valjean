A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.</p><p>The grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;The wonderful, beautiful girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And she has so sweet and good an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that I have ever seen in my life. Later on, she&rsquo;ll have virtues with an odor of violets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a creature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don&rsquo;t go to pettifogging, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
