<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!</p><p>The invisible inexorable, what an obsession!</p><p>Then, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; make your choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings into that well the labor of one&rsquo;s whole life, one flings in one&rsquo;s fortune, one flings in one&rsquo;s riches, one flings in one&rsquo;s success, one flings in one&rsquo;s liberty or fatherland, one flings in one&rsquo;s well-being, one flings in one&rsquo;s repose, one flings in one&rsquo;s joy! More! more! more! Empty the vase! tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one&rsquo;s heart.</p></div> </div>
