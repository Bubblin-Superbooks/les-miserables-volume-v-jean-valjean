They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his father&rsquo;s grave.</p><p>Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it.</p><p>Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, &ldquo;looks before her.&rdquo; Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and involuntary on the part of the young.</p></div> </div>
