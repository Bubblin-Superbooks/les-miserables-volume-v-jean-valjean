<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We will confine ourselves to noting an incident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked the transit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul.</p><p>At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in process of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du Parc-Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the simplest way was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guests observed that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a jam of vehicles.&mdash;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked M. Gillenormand&mdash;&ldquo;Because of the maskers.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said the grandfather, &ldquo;let us go that way. These young folks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the serious part of life. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
