They are hiding!&rdquo;</p><p>The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men, attacked by ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they did as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they came over the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight, all were killed there with the exception of the leader, Barth√©lemy, of whom we shall speak presently.</p><p>The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade of the Temple was silence.
