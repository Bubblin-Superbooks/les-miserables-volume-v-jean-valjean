<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They told me that you could put your fist in it. And then, it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors. That is frightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left. It is queer that a person can suffer like that. Your grandfather has a very kindly air. Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself, don&rsquo;t rise on your elbow, you will injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our unhappiness is over! I am quite foolish. I had things to say to you, and I no longer know in the least what they were. Do you still love me? We live in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arm√©. There is no garden. I made lint all the time; stay, sir, look, it is your fault, I have a callous on my fingers.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
