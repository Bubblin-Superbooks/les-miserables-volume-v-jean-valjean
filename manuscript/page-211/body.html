<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces; one&rsquo;s head has been in the light of the future. There were corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows have passed by. What were they?</p><p>One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths which shouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in the midst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on one&rsquo;s finger nails. One no longer remembers anything.</p></div> </div>
