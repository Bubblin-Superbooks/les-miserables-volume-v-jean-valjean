<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A terrible situation! to be touched.</p><p>To be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one&rsquo;s breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass of returning good for good, although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the intruder&rsquo;s hand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand! to suddenly feel one&rsquo;s fingers opening! to relax one&rsquo;s grip,&mdash;what a terrible thing!</p></div> </div>
